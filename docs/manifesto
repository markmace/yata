# YATA Manifesto

## Focus on Today, Not Tomorrow

### Simple by Design
Productivity tools should work quietly in the background. Our interface exists to help you get things done, not to impress you with features. Every interaction should feel natural and obvious.

### Today Comes First
Today is what matters most. We design for people who want to focus on what they can actually accomplish right now, not endless planning for the distant future.

### Flexible Task Management
Tasks don't have to be rigid. If something planned for Tuesday isn't done, you can easily move it to Wednesday or next week. Or decide it wasn't important after all. Your productivity app shouldn't make you feel guilty about changing your mind.

### Smart Short-Term Planning
Plan clearly for the next few days, thoughtfully for the next week, and loosely beyond that. We help you focus on the time horizon where you can actually take action.

### Helpful, Not Pushy
When YATA suggests something or sends a reminder, it's gentle and useful. No aggressive notifications or guilt-inducing statistics. We help when it's helpful and stay quiet when it's not.

### Learn from the Past, Don't Dwell on It
Yesterday's unfinished tasks are available when you need them, but they don't clutter today's view. We track what happened so you can learn from it, not to make you feel bad about it.

### Clean and Focused
Our design is minimal and purposeful. We use color sparingly and keep interfaces uncluttered. Every element has a reason for being there.

### Prevent Overwhelm
Complex features often create more problems than they solve. We deliberately limit options to help you focus on what actually needs to be done rather than getting lost in productivity theater.

### Calm Technology
No constant notifications or attention-grabbing badges. YATA appears when you need it and disappears when you don't. Technology should help you think clearly, not interrupt your peace.

### Priorities Change
People's goals and tasks naturally evolve over time. We make it easy to let go of things that are no longer important and focus on what matters now.

### Intuitive Interactions
Our interface should feel natural and follow established patterns. Swiping, dragging, and tapping should behave as users expect. Sliding tasks horizontally reveals actions, while grabbing and moving should allow for reordering. Every interaction should be discoverable and consistent.

### Progressive Disclosure
Complex features should be accessible but not overwhelming. We show the most common actions upfront and reveal additional functionality when needed. This creates a clean interface that grows with the user's expertise.

### Tactile Feedback
Digital interactions should feel physical and satisfying. Subtle animations, haptic feedback, and visual cues should make the app feel responsive and alive, without being distracting.
