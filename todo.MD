Near term TODOs

- get a logo (white, black Y in Verdana?)
- Use actual logo in app
- Fix delete
- Max copy and edit less like buttons?
- Get TODO movement to work
- Group together completed
- Have special section for longer term todos/todos you dont want to assign to specific day, once set, will start showing up but in a different color/theme than normal todos
- test roll over of events -- probably broken AF 
- Have 'other' lists, that are not tied to a specific day
- Once it is minimally viable, get it on my phone to test
- Start actually hosting it? simple auth, simple datastore, only for me for now, but allow me to shit new versions and maintain functionality?
